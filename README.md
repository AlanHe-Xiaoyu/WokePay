# CalHacks 5.0 - Wokepay
WokePay is a unique iOS app that serves as the extension/complement of PayPal that could: <br/>
(1) Detecting facial expressions and recognizing emotions during the purchase; <br/>
(2) Rate the worthiness regarding the purchase; and <br/>
(3) Prevent unnecessary shopping by analyzing and categorizing the past purchases. <br/>
<br/>
Members of our team dreamed about having a personal finance app, WokePay, that could automatically read our purchase history, categorize them, decide whether each purchase gives us long-term satisfaction or is just caused by a whimsical thought. We wish to promote sustainable consumption and prevent impulsive squandering. Thus, we decided to take upon the challenge of PayPal, since it corresponds to our aspirations, and to utilize its APIs to our advantage of building WokePay. <br/>
<br/>
Our team plans on further developing the app so that we could incorporate the data analytics into WokePay by gathering more information from users to train for a better prediction/categorization model.
